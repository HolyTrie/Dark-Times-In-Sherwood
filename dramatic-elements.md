# Dramatic Componenets

## Challenge
* To play our game the player will have to be skilled with playing games with keyboard and mouse and have an open minded regarding puzzle solving and trap avoidance, we will host a tutorial that will teach everything the new player is going to face, but will keep some things in the dark for excitment and challenge. </br>
* Our game will start with simple proluge showing the player how the basic game mechanics works. Our goal is to make the levels in an ascending diffculity - At the start the levels will be "simple" and as he keeps progressing through the story he will unravel new game mechanincs and the levels will get more diffcult. </br>

## Flow
* To focus our player we will add ambient music to the game that will fit each stage the player is at (fighting/resting/main-menu). </br>
* To give feedback to our player it will be based on quests - if the player succeded with the quest it will pop up with "mission completed". </br>

## Fun
* To add extra layer to the game, we might add secret "coins" that the player has to collect during his voyage to the crypt. </br>
* Our game is mainly focused to audience - "achieveable" and "explorer" </br>
