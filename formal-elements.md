## Formal Elements
![Untitled](https://github.com/HolyTrie/Dark-Times-In-Sherwood/assets/73063105/8bac977b-4586-41d2-9635-99f457121f17)


### 1. Players

* Our game is inteded for a somewhat mature audience that has played video games before and is familiar with the rougelike/lite genres. </br> 
* This game can be played single player but also support coop of up to 4 players. </br>
* Players will delve into danger together as a team and will have to beat each level by cooparting with each other </br>

### 2. Goals
* Long term goals: Finish the main storyline via quest completion, And beat the final boss. </br>
* Medium term goals: complete quests, side quests, and reach milestones to unlock upgrades. </br>
* short term goals: every level will have a combination of monsters, traps, and puzzles which hinder the player from reaching a treasure located inside, the player/s must bypass said hazards to reach the treasure, retrieve it, and leave the level succesfully, players will have to manage themselves, their HP/Stamina, and their wits to escape unscathed. </br></br>
* the player learns their goals by interacting with the world, either through trial and error or interacting with NPC's that may provide useful information.


### 3. Proccesses 
* at the start of the game, robin hood and friends interrupt a ritual only to have their souls shackled by the evil sheriff of nottingham, they then begin to hear dark voices which explain their goals and the game to them, leading to a 'tutorial' or 'epilogue' level.
* The main procces A.K.A the game loop will be embarking on an expedition to some ruined/cursed/horrible place to retrieve a treasure/artifact, players will have to face combat parkour and puzzles to retrieve the treasure/artifact to receive a reward per level, scaling with difficulty, the harder the level the greater the reward.
* some levels will contain special challenges, such as a boss fight, which may progress the game or unlock upgrades.
* players will be able to accept and complete quests, some of which are required to progress the story
* certain NPC's will offer the player the opportunity to Trade for items, or Upgrade his gear, but only in the Hub.
* we expect the movement to work with WASD keys, E for interacting, Spacebar for jumping, and the mouse for combat - with buttons 1-9 being abilities or items 

### 4. Rules
* basic rules like movement and the world boundaries, the way combat works and how much damage things do, how to solve puzzles, are all a set of basic rules - some of which will be explained to the player via a tutorial and other are expected to be learnt by trial & error.
* every action in the game will have a predefined result (for example hitting an NPC does nothing, but hitting a monster takes down X hp)
* if player/s die in a level they return to the hub with a penalty (such as gettingt only 25% of the reward)

### 5. Resources
* Resources - Health and Stamina Points, Gold Reputation, Reputation
* A player whos health reaches 0 will DIE and lose the level - resetting at the hub with a penalty, HP is precious as there would be limited way to restore it (such as hp potions and POI in levels)
* Stamina determines for how long can the player run or when he can use his abilites, its not rare but managing it might be the difference between death and life.
* Gold will be used for upgrades throughout the game - (we could also add a taxation system to really hurt Robin and Co')
* The player will earn gold for defeating monsters, solving puzzles (depends on the puzzles), and retrieving the treasure succesfully, levels may also feature random gold scattered about for players to pick up, if required this resoruce could be made relatively scarce to hinder the player.
* The plyaer will receive explanation about these resources in the Tutorial (reading) and if he decides to ignore this he will just learn this via trial and error (running around, getting hit, dying etc...), and getting gold also works the same, all these elements will be visible on the UI.
* Reputation will present the player/s with a dilemma between gold or gear, and their good name - as reputation will affect the story, how NPC's treat the player/s and is essentially their moral compass
* 
### 6. Conflicts
* the basic conflicts will be between the player and enemy monsters, parkour challenges and witty puzzles, while the main conflict is essentially betwene robin and Co' against the evil Sheriff.
* The players will have to work together to solve some of the puzzles, and take down tough enemies, and they may also be presented with difficult dilemmas along the way, making them make hard choices, or 'soft' dilemmas like choosing the path they prefer - this choice can be based off the difficulty to reward ratio of levels or paths. 

### 7. Boundaries
* the game will consist of closed levels, and will NOT be open world - the player/s will learn this via trial and error, and some aspects of leaving/entering areas will be explained via tutorial.
* every level will have at least one purpose, the Hub will have many purposes such as upgrading your gear or buying potions etc.., and every level will have a main goal of retrieving an artifact/treasure and may contain a side goal which may lead to loot or provide a dilemma.
* every level will have different level of navigatabillity, th Hub will be easy to naviagte while the levels may prsent different level of challenge.
* players will have to familiarize themselves with the Hub, but every level will offer some navigational challenge, important things maybe be highlighted in implicit or explicit ways, such as highlighting interactable NPC's or Doors.
* levels will have easy to complicated layouts which may present different levels of challenge to navigatem and thus be more interesting then just a combat encounter on a flat map.
### 8. Results
* the game will have Major and Minor results, the Minor results are the obvious things like, clearing a level and getting a reward, dying and getting a penalty, and completing quests.
* the games major results will be tied to the storyline and the heroes reputation, but there will be at most 2 - a Good and Bad ending.
* the games end result depends on the story and is thus linear but complex.

## Market Survey
We searched by three categories, the first being robin hood inspired game with a dark aesthetic, the second being roguelikes and roguelites which contain puzzles in them, and the third was popular roguelikes and roguelites.
the most similar games were:
[Hood: Outlaws & Legends](https://store.steampowered.com/app/927350/Hood_Outlaws__Legends/) - similar only in aesthetic </br>
[Spellslayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1nLZeVX6gI&ab_channel=WhiteFalconPlays) - a top down tactical rogulike with puzzles </br>
[Vertical Kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8LIL6Vhwm4&ab_channel=FGsquared) - a Roguelite Puzzle City Builder </br>

[Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) </br>

and the 3 most similar out these are Hood: Outlaws & Legends, Dead Cells, Celeste, for their Aesthetic, Combat, and Platforming respectively.
our game will attempt to take the best elements of these games and mix in puzzles as well, if done well this would create and extremely niche game - of course this hinges on the puzzles being challenging but not too much as to not push people away.
