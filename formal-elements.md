## רכיבים רשמיים

ענו על השאלות הבאות לגבי הרכיבים הרשמיים של המשחק
(החליפו את הטקסט של השאלות בתשובות שלכם).

המחישו את התשובות שלכם בעזרת ציורי-מסך.

### 1. Players

* Our game is inteded for a somewhat mature audience that has played video games before and is familiar with the rougelike/lite genres. </br> 
* This game can be played single player but also support coop of up to 4 players. </br>
* Players will delve into danger together as a team and will have to beat each level by cooparting with each other </br>

### 2. Goals
* Long term goals: Finish the main storyline via quest completion, And beat the final boss. </br>
* Medium term goals: complete quests, side quests, and reach milestones to unlock upgrades. </br>
* short term goals: every level will have a combination of monsters, traps, and puzzles which hinder the player from reaching a treasure located inside, the player/s must bypass said hazards to reach the treasure, retrieve it, and leave the level succesfully, players will have to manage themselves, their HP/Stamina, and their wits to escape unscathed. </br></br>
* the player learns their goals by interacting with the world, either through trial and error or interacting with NPC's that may provide useful information.


### 3. Proccesses 

תארו בפירוט את:

* תהליך ההתחלה של המשחק - שלושים השניות הראשונות (זה הזמן ששחקן ממוצע, שייתקל במשחק שלכם באינטרנט, ישחק בו לפני שיחליט אם להמשיך או לא. מה תעשו כדי לגרום לו להישאר?);
*	תהליך הליבה של המשחק – רצף-הפעולות שהשחקן מבצע שוב ושוב על-מנת להתקדם במשחק.
*	תהליך הסיום של המשחק – הפעולות שהשחקן מבצע כדי לנצח / לסיים את המשחק.
לגבי כל תהליך, ענו על השאלות: "מי עושה מה, איפה, מתי, ואיך?".  תארו באיזה פקדים השחקן ישתמש (עכבר / מקלדת / מגע), ומה יקרה במשחק כתוצאה מכך.

איך השחקן ילמד על התהליכים? 

### 4. חוקים

* איזה חוקים יגבילו את פעולות השחקן במשחק?
* לפי איזה חוקים ייקבעו תוצאות של פעולות במשחק?
* איך השחקן ילמד את חוקי המשחק?


### 5. משאבים
* Resources - Health and Stamina Points, Gold
* A player whos health reaches 0 will DIE and lose the level - resetting at the hub with a penalty (TBD)
* Stamina determines for how long can the player run or when he can use his abilites
* Gold will be used for upgrades throughout the game - (we could also add a taxation system to really hurt roib and Co')
* The player will earn gold for defeating monsters, solving puzzles (depends on the puzzles), and retrieving the treasure succesfully, levels may also feature random gold scattered about for players to pick up, HP will be set at the start of the level and players will be able to restore it via abilities or restorative consumables, Stamina is similar but also regenerates whenever the player isnt running/casting.
* Stamina wouldnt be a rare resource but players will have to manage their stamina wisely or die, and HP is precious since it can only be regenerated by abilites or consumables - if these are rare then so is HP, for Gold we could go in two ways, either make it plentiful and scale the numbers UP, or make it scarce and keep the number LOW
* The plyaer will receive explanation about these resources in the Tutorial (reading) and if he decides to ignore this he will just learn this via trial and error (running around, getting hit, dying etc...), and getting gold also works the same, all these elements will be visible on the UI.
* מה יהיו המשאבים במשחק?
* איך המשאבים הללו יועילו לשחקן?
* איך השחקן יוכל להשיג משאבים?
* איך עיצוב המשחק יגרום לכך שהמשאבים יהיו נדירים (שלא יהיה קל מדי להשיג אותם)?
* איך המשחק יודיע לשחקן מה הם המשאבים במשחק, וכמה משאבים יש לו בכל רגע?

### 6. עימותים

מה יהיו העימותים המרכזיים במשחק:

* בין השחקן למערכת (מכשולים),
* בין השחקן לשחקנים אחרים (יריבים),
* בין השחקן לעצמו (דילמות)? 


### 7. Boundaries
* the game will consist of closed levels, and will NOT be open world - the player/s will learn this via trial and error, and some aspects of leaving/entering areas will be explained via tutorial.
* every level will have at least one purpose, the Hub will have many purposes such as upgrading your gear or buying potions etc.., and every level will have a main goal of retrieving an artifact/treasure and may contain a side goal which may lead to loot or provide a dilemma.
* every level will have different level of navigatabillity, th Hub will be easy to naviagte while the levels may prsent different level of challenge.
* players will have to familiarize themselves with the Hub, but every level will offer some navigational challenge, important things maybe be highlighted in implicit or explicit ways, such as highlighting interactable NPC's or Doors.
* levels will have easy to complicated layouts which may present different levels of challenge to navigatem and thus be more interesting then just a combat encounter on a flat map.
### 8. Results
* the game will have Major and Minor results, the Minor results are the obvious things like, clearing a level and getting a reward, dying and getting a penalty, and completing quests.
* the games major results will be tied to the storyline and the heroes reputation, but there will be at most 2 - a Good and Bad ending.
* the games end result depends on the story and is thus linear but complex.

## Market Survey
We searched by three categories, the first being robin hood inspired game with a dark aesthetic, the second being roguelikes and roguelites which contain puzzles in them, and the third was popular roguelikes and roguelites.
the most similar games were:
(Hood: Outlaws & Legends)[https://store.steampowered.com/app/927350/Hood_Outlaws__Legends/] - similar in aesthetic </br>
(Spellslayer)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1nLZeVX6gI&ab_channel=WhiteFalconPlays] - a top down tactical rogulike with puzzles </br>
(Vertical Kingdom)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8LIL6Vhwm4&ab_channel=FGsquared] - a Roguelite Puzzle City Builder </br>
(Celeste)[https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/] </br>
(Dead Cells)[https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/] </br>
(Hollow Knight)[https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/] </br>

and the 3 most similar out these are Hood: Outlaws & Legends, Dead Cells, Celeste, for their Aesthetic, Combat, and Platforming respectively.
our game will attempt to take the best elements of these games and mix in puzzles as well, if done well this would create and extremely niche game - of course this hinges on the puzzles being challenging but not too much as to not push people away.
</br>
We also found '(puzzles_in_roguelikes)[https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/4xzc5j/puzzles_in_roguelikes/]' which was interesting.
