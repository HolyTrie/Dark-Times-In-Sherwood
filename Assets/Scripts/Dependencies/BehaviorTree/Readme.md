This is a simple Behaviour Tree (A.K.A BTree or BT) implemented by Mina Picheux (todo - linkage) </br>
</br>
We added the BTreeBuilder class to alleviate the problem in Mina's initialization of trees where the developer can quickly lose track of all the scopes, especially in bigger BT's.
It's not perfect but it's much clearer to the developer what's the trees hierarchy.
